# Java-Video-Game
A very simple game using the Rage game engine that was designed for teaching students how to utilize and program under an engine.
The game was to be created in a Semester at Sacramento State Univeristy. This game was a product of learning a brand new enginge and working under
a severe time constraint.

In order to run the game, the machine must be specifically configured to run the rage game engine. The necessary files can be found on the 
California State University Sacramento website.

Read the player's guide to see who created which assests or where they were used from. Almost every asset was created by myself (Jason Phillips) and 
my partner Andrew wright.

The code was a collaborative effort and written by myself and Andrew Wright.
